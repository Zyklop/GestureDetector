The best user experiences are context aware:
The interface should adapt as the distance between the user and the Kinect changes
The interface should respond to the number and engagement of users
The placement of controls should be designed based on expected user movements or actions

Each input method is best at something and worst at something:
Users will choose the input which requires the least overall effort for a given scenario
Users tend to stick to a single input when not given a reason to change
Inputs should be reliable, consistent, and convenient, otherwise users will look for alternative options
Switching inputs should happen naturally, or at natural transition points in the scenario

Confident users are happy users:
It is important to keep interactions simple and easy to learn and master
Avoid misinterpreting user intent. To increase confidence, use input combinations such as voice and gesture together.
Give constant feedback so users always know what’s happening and what to expect.

The strongest designs come after user testing:
Kinect enables a lot of new interactions, but also new challenges
It is especially hard to guess what will work and what will not ahead of time
Sometimes minor adjustments can make a huge difference
User test often and early, and plan time into your schedule for multiple adjustments to your design

How you setup the environment where your Kinect application is used can make a huge difference in perceived reliability and usability. Controlling as many of the following factors as possible will help make your user experience shine and reduce the likelihood of disrupted interactions. Whenever possible, test your application early and often in the environment in which you plan to use it.

People and Crowds: If the environment you are designing for will have many people moving around the sensor, make sure you use the right tracking mode and design your space so that other people won’t walk between the active user and the Kinect.

Ambient Noise: If you are relying on voice as an input method, keep in mind that the environment should be very quiet for it to be reliable. If you cannot control the noise level of the environment, try having the user interact closer to the sensor. If it is too noisy, voice may not be the right input method.

Screen Size and Resolution: Choose an appropriate display for the distance at which you expect users to interact. Remember that the size of your interface will depend on how far back your users are and what they can comfortably see.

Lighting: Avoid environments that have large amounts of natural light as it will make skeletal tracking less reliable. The depth camera won’t work in direct sunlight or any full spectrum lighting. Dim lighting is fine for depth but will degrade the RGB image quality.

Extra Objects or Clothing: Items that drastically change the shape of a human wearing or holding them may confuse skeletal tracking. Also, items or clothing material that is reflective will interfere with the IR reflection and make skeletal tracking less reliable.

Sensor Placement: When placing the sensor, it is helpful if the camera is directly facing the subjects it expected to track. It is helpful if the sensor can see the floor so it can better orient itself. Avoid extreme tilt angles.

Interactions and interfaces built with Kinect can enable magical experiences for your users. The magic and delight of Kinect comes when the user knows how to use the interface and feels natural doing it. Your development of touch free, natural UI with Kinect is the beginning of a revolution that will shape the way we experience and interact with software applications. Someday you will not simply remember how the Kinect revolution started, but how your application helped shape it.

Lighting: Avoid environments that have large amounts of natural light as it will make skeletal tracking less reliable. The depth camera won’t work in direct sunlight or any full spectrum lighting. Dim lighting is fine for depth but will degrade the RGB image quality.

Extra Objects or Clothing: Items that drastically change the shape of a human wearing or holding them may confuse skeletal tracking. Also, items or clothing material that is reflective will interfere with the IR reflection and make skeletal tracking less reliable.

Sensor Placement: When placing the sensor, it is helpful if the camera is directly facing the subjects it expected to track. It is helpful if the sensor can see the floor so it can better orient itself. Avoid extreme tilt angles.

Interactions and interfaces built with Kinect can enable magical experiences for your users. The magic and delight of Kinect comes when the user knows how to use the interface and feels natural doing it. Your development of touch free, natural UI with Kinect is the beginning of a revolution that will shape the way we experience and interact with software applications. Someday you will not simply remember how the Kinect revolution started, but how your application helped shape it.

The best user experiences are context aware:
The interface should adapt as the distance between the user and the Kinect changes
The interface should respond to the number and engagement of users
The placement of controls should be designed based on expected user movements or actions

Each input method is best at something and worst at something:
Users will choose the input which requires the least overall effort for a given scenario
Users tend to stick to a single input when not given a reason to change
Inputs should be reliable, consistent, and convenient, otherwise users will look for alternative options
Switching inputs should happen naturally, or at natural transition points in the scenario

Confident users are happy users:
It is important to keep interactions simple and easy to learn and master
Avoid misinterpreting user intent. To increase confidence, use input combinations such as voice and gesture together.
Give constant feedback so users always know what’s happening and what to expect.

The strongest designs come after user testing:
Kinect enables a lot of new interactions, but also new challenges
It is especially hard to guess what will work and what will not ahead of time
Sometimes minor adjustments can make a huge difference
User test often and early, and plan time into your schedule for multiple adjustments to your design

How you setup the environment where your Kinect application is used can make a huge difference in perceived reliability and usability. Controlling as many of the following factors as possible will help make your user experience shine and reduce the likelihood of disrupted interactions. Whenever possible, test your application early and often in the environment in which you plan to use it.

People and Crowds: If the environment you are designing for will have many people moving around the sensor, make sure you use the right tracking mode and design your space so that other people won’t walk between the active user and the Kinect.

Ambient Noise: If you are relying on voice as an input method, keep in mind that the environment should be very quiet for it to be reliable. If you cannot control the noise level of the environment, try having the user interact closer to the sensor. If it is too noisy, voice may not be the right input method.

Screen Size and Resolution: Choose an appropriate display for the distance at which you expect users to interact. Remember that the size of your interface will depend on how far back your users are and what they can comfortably see.

How you setup the environment where your Kinect application is used can make a huge difference in perceived reliability and usability. Controlling as many of the following factors as possible will help make your user experience shine and reduce the likelihood of disrupted interactions. Whenever possible, test your application early and often in the environment in which you plan to use it.

People and Crowds: If the environment you are designing for will have many people moving around the sensor, make sure you use the right tracking mode and design your space so that other people won’t walk between the active user and the Kinect.

Ambient Noise: If you are relying on voice as an input method, keep in mind that the environment should be very quiet for it to be reliable. If you cannot control the noise level of the environment, try having the user interact closer to the sensor. If it is too noisy, voice may not be the right input method.

Screen Size and Resolution: Choose an appropriate display for the distance at which you expect users to interact. Remember that the size of your interface will depend on how far back your users are and what they can comfortably see.

Lighting: Avoid environments that have large amounts of natural light as it will make skeletal tracking less reliable. The depth camera won’t work in direct sunlight or any full spectrum lighting. Dim lighting is fine for depth but will degrade the RGB image quality.

Extra Objects or Clothing: Items that drastically change the shape of a human wearing or holding them may confuse skeletal tracking. Also, items or clothing material that is reflective will interfere with the IR reflection and make skeletal tracking less reliable.

Sensor Placement: When placing the sensor, it is helpful if the camera is directly facing the subjects it expected to track. It is helpful if the sensor can see the floor so it can better orient itself. Avoid extreme tilt angles.

Interactions and interfaces built with Kinect can enable magical experiences for your users. The magic and delight of Kinect comes when the user knows how to use the interface and feels natural doing it. Your development of touch free, natural UI with Kinect is the beginning of a revolution that will shape the way we experience and interact with software applications. Someday you will not simply remember how the Kinect revolution started, but how your application helped shape it.

The best user experiences are context aware:
The interface should adapt as the distance between the user and the Kinect changes
The interface should respond to the number and engagement of users
The placement of controls should be designed based on expected user movements or actions

Each input method is best at something and worst at something:
Users will choose the input which requires the least overall effort for a given scenario
Users tend to stick to a single input when not given a reason to change
Inputs should be reliable, consistent, and convenient, otherwise users will look for alternative options
Switching inputs should happen naturally, or at natural transition points in the scenario

Confident users are happy users:
It is important to keep interactions simple and easy to learn and master
Avoid misinterpreting user intent. To increase confidence, use input combinations such as voice and gesture together.
Give constant feedback so users always know what’s happening and what to expect.
