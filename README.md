# Kinect Gesture Detector
The Kinect Gesture Detector Toolset can be used for recognizing gestures and developing your own ones with the Microsoft Kinect SDK.

The Kinect Gesture Detector project startet as a HSR term paper for M&F Engineering Dietikon. It consists of a simple gesture recognition framework for the Microsoft Kinect and provides a toolset for using basic gestures and creating new ones. Use it for Windows Desktop applications or input emulation in games.

Our main targets:
- easy to use
- well-arranged design
